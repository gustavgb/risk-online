![Risk logo](src/images/card_back.png)

This repo contains a virtual risk board built in React with Firebase as backend. It allows players to play the traditional board game of Risk. However, the game *does not* implement any rules or game checking, also there are no dice. The players are encouraged to play while speaking to each other and rolling a physical die.

Features thus far:

* Creating and maintaining a game
* Inviting players to your game
* Choosing a color
* Placing armies, moving and removing them
* Missions
* Initial territories
* Taking cards
* Showing and discarding cards
* Throwing a random card, in case you take one too many
* Event log and helpers to locate realtime updates
* See who is online

> Note: The game is only implemented in Danish
